This project is meant to emulate the DVD waiting screen. The DVD logo
would bounce off the walls and everyone would wait for it to hit the corner.

Trying to follow this github:
https://github.com/abhayMore/Bouncing-DVD-Logo/blob/master/main.cpp

While also looking at this write up:
https://dev.to/dwarft/displaying-images-in-sfml-b6m

But I'm defo coding it in wrong, right now I'm working at just getting the
logo png file to load in and then display on the screen. We can worry about
sizing and movement later.
